Getting Started
===============

ScreenFlow is based on Screen
------------------------------

There is no screen flow without screen obviously, so an application built with **ScreenFlow**
requires to create and connect together a serie of screens. The application switch from
one screen to another by sliding horizontally, keeping the navigation state into an internal stack.

A **Screen** aims to be dedicated to a single task, for exemple : 

- Input text
- Allow user to select option
- View a list or a grid of items
- And so on ...

That is why lot of basic **Screen** implementation are already available as in.
